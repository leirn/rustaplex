This project aims at creating a Rust port of Supaplex.

It is freely and largely inspired but the great work within [open-supaplex](https://github.com/sergiou87/open-supaplex).

## Licence

This software is distributed under licence GPL V3.

## Known limitations

The development is currently ongoing and the game is not playable yet.
Nevertheless, some limitation will remain for version 1:

- Rustaplex 0.1 will only support real keyboard and will not support touch screen, unlike open-supaplex. This feature may be added in a later version. We are currently focusing of having a functional game.
